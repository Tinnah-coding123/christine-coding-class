                        Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of time.

Unlike humans, dogs don’t have the ability to create actual measures of time,

like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t know how to read clocks.

So, telling them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much,

but we understand that you feel like you have to do it anyway!

Dogs are capable of being trained based on past events, and can be taught

to anticipate future events based on past experiences.

Pavlov’s dogs are the perfect example of this.

                        The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf.

                        Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from
                        
                        extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the modern wolf
                        
                        is the dog's nearest living relative.
                        
                        Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers
                        
                        over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture.
